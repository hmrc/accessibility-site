<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Use screen magnification</h1>

<p class="govuk-body-l">Screen magnification is zooming part of the display so a person with lower visual acuity can determine page content.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Typically the magnification will mean that the user will move their finger or cursor around the screen to explore the page.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What to look for</h3>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>where pages change layout (for example where most pages donâ€™t use a sidebar, but the odd one does as this suggests a learned pattern which is then broken)</li>
  <li>pages which have related content remote from each other without any indicator to tie them together (for example a Check Your Answer page is missing the line under each row)</li>
  <li>hover states which cover information or which contain information that cannot be read in full without moving off the trigger area</li>
</ul>
